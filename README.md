# TextAssociator
TextAssociator is a general tool that will allow maintain one directional word associations by using a self-resizing,
non-generic HashTable, using separate chaining as collision resolution

In this application, TextAssociator stores a set of "key words" into a HashTable, and their corrosponding "enhanced words". When user inputs any word, program will randomly choose an "enhanced" word to that word. If given word is not found in the key words set, original word will be returned.
